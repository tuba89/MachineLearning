Machine Learning case studies
This repo contains all my projects in supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning till now.

Case studies of some datasets.

  
 

I-   Supervized Machine learning:
  ----------------------------


  1- Testing My Python skills
  2- cleaning and visualisation and exploring titanic_passengers data set
  3- Predicting House prices with linear regression and polynomial regression
  4- apply logistic regression in titanic_pensenger and predict survival 
  5- apply k-nearest neighbors in iris dataset and test accuracy
  6- apply DecisionTree and random forest alogorithm in titanic dataset and test my models accuracy
  
  
II-  UnSupervized Machine learning:
  ----------------------------
   
  7- apply hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering in credit card segmentation dataset
  8- Recommendation System applying apriori algorithm in MarketBasket dataset


  


***// I will implement more projects progressively as time goes by //***
